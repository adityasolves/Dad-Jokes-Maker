## Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s an example of how we fetch the joke:

```javascript
async function getJoke() {
    const url = `https://icanhazdadjoke.com/`;
    const response = await fetch(url, {
        headers: {
            'Accept': 'application/json'
        }
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.joke;
}
